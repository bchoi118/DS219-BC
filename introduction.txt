Hi, I'm Brian.
One of the more memorable courses I've taken at BU so far would be AR230, where I got to learn more about Greek and Roman archaeology. It was a great break from the usual CS oriented courses, and it was also nice to visit the MFA and to start noticing many of the Greek and Roman architectural inspirations found around Boston.
